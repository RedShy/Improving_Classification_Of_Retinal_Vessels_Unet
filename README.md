# Improving Classification Of Retinal Vessels Unet
Trained a Convolutional Neural Network with Pytorch to classify blood vessels as artery/vein. Implemented first in
ASP and then in Python several biological constraints that improved the network’s F-measure of ~4 %. Designed a follow-up
training that improved the network’s accuracy of ~3 %.
